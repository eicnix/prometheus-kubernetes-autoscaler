# Prometheus Kubernetes Autoscaler
Scale Kubernetes deployments based on Prometheus alerts. 

## How does it work?
The autoscaler is registered as a webhook alertmanager receiver. When an alert is forwarded to this receiver the alertmanager will contact the autoscaler.  
The notifications send by the alertmanager need to contain these annotations: 

```yaml
alertmanager-config.yaml:
global:
    resolve_timeout: 5m

route:
    group_by: ['service']
    group_wait: 10s
    group_interval: 10s 
    repeat_interval: 1h
    receiver: 'webhook'
receivers:
- name: 'webhook'
    webhook_configs:
    - url: 'http://prometheus-kubernetes-autoscaler-go/alert
```

|action|scaling that should be performed. Either `up` or `down`|

## Installation
To run this project you need the following tools:
* [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/)
* [Draft](https://github.com/Azure/draft/)
* [Helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile)


1. Run `helmfile sync` to install the alertmanager
2. Run `draft up` to install the autoscaler
3. Port-forward the alertmanager api to `localhost:9093`.
4. Run `generate-alert.sh` to generate an alert and watch the scaling happen
